hi@JeffJassky.com

![2018.jpg](/img/2018.jpg)

I'm a creative technologist. I design, photograph, build, and code.

I use art and tech to develop tools and experiences for brands, marketers, festivals, nightlife, film makers, non-profits, and anywhere that needs a dose of whimsy.

My mediums include software, robotics, audio, visual, photo, video, lighting, and AI, or whatever else required to make people feel special.

My favorite clients embrace experimentation, cutting-edge technologies, and new media.

Let's work together.

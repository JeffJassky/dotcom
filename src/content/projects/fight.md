# **Mayweather vs McGregor**Engineering a PPV service for millions

### 2017

My team built and launched the Pay-Per-View service for the Showtime broadcast of the Mayweather vs McGregor boxing match. We deployed a NodeJS API on scalable AWS servers and deployed clients for iOS, Apple TV, Android, and Web.  The web service included multiple DRM-encrypted video and audio streams, a customized HTML5 video player and built on a platform of Backbone/Marionette front end and credit card processing through Recurly.

4.6 million purchases, and $600 million later, the Pay-Per-View service we had deployed was deemed a success. Stephen Espinoza, EVP and General Manager of Showtime Sports reported that the fight “generated four times the number of streaming buys than we projected” and “Overall, the streaming was a high point.”

# **Wearable Nostalgia That Almost Became a Petri Dish**

### Liquid Vision (2015)

I made glasses with moving colored liquid inside the lenses - like looking through one of those oil-and-water novelty toys from childhood, but on your face. We sold them at DRTY SMMR. One pair got stolen, which I took as a compliment.

## The Vision

When I was a kid, my dad had a few of those oil-and-water desk toys. You flip them over and watch the tinted oil cascade down through the water in slow, psychedelic drips. I stared at those things for hours.

One night in New York, I had an idea: what if you could wear that? Glasses where the lenses themselves were liquid chambers, colors slowly drifting across your field of view. Looking through rose-colored glasses, literally - except the rose is moving.

## The Fabrication Challenge

The goal was simple: make sealed liquid chambers in the shape of eyeglass lenses.

The execution was not simple.

I experimented at Fat Cat Fab Lab with every technique available:

- **Laser cutting** - Fast for prototyping, but left sharp edges
- **CNC machining** - Better finish, more control over contours
- **3D printing** - Good for frames, not great for optical clarity

The lenses needed to be two pieces of clear acrylic with a sealed gap between them. I bonded them using **acrylic cement**, which chemically melts both surfaces together into a single fused piece. No glue, no gaskets - the lens and frame become one solid object. If the bond was good, it wouldn't leak.

About eight prototypes before I got something that was both sealed and wearable.

## The Wearability Problem

Early prototypes were laser cut, which meant the edges were sharp. The part that sits on the bridge of your nose? Uncomfortable. Nobody wants to wear something that digs into their face.

Later versions were CNC machined with rounded, contoured edges that actually fit a human nose.

For the temple arms - the parts that hook over your ears - I skipped the traditional folding hinges entirely. Instead, I used **styled chain material** that draped behind the ears. It looked great, very fashion-forward. But chains aren't as stable as rigid arms. The glasses stayed on, but they moved around more than traditional frames.

Trade-off accepted. They were art pieces, not daily drivers.

## The Petri Dish Problem

Here's something I didn't anticipate: liquid sandwiched between two clear lenses, with sunlight filtering through, creates almost perfect laboratory conditions for bacterial growth.

One of my early prototypes went bad. I picked it up one day and it looked _literally like a petri dish_ - cloudy, with visible colonies growing in the liquid. The water, dye, and mineral oil mixture was basically a buffet for microorganisms.

I had accidentally built a wearable bacteria incubator.

The fix required switching to antimicrobial liquids - formulations that wouldn't encourage mold and bacterial growth inside sealed chambers. The visual effect stayed the same, but the liquid chemistry had to change completely.

## The Final Product

About eight pairs of finished glasses, each one hand-made:

- CNC machined acrylic frames and lens chambers
- Chemically bonded seals
- Antimicrobial liquid fill
- Chain-style temples
- Various color combinations

## Life at DRTY SMMR

DRTY SMMR was a clothing and fashion boutique / art house in Bushwick - the same space where I lived and built Reflx and Brobot. We displayed the glasses there, and they became a fixture.

People coming through the store would try them on, take selfies, watch the liquid move. They photographed well - we used them in multiple shoots. The combination of wearable art and interactive novelty made them irresistible.

We sold several pairs. And one got stolen.

I took that as the highest compliment. Someone wanted them badly enough to take them. That's a kind of validation you can't manufacture.

## What I Learned

**Childhood nostalgia is a powerful design prompt.** The oil-and-water toys weren't sophisticated, but they stuck with me for decades. That emotional resonance translated directly into something people connected with.

**Biology will find a way.** If you're sealing liquid into anything transparent, you're creating a potential growth medium. Think like a microbiologist, not just a fabricator.

**Wearability is its own engineering discipline.** Something can be beautiful and well-made and still uncomfortable to wear. The nose bridge, the temple fit, the weight distribution - these details matter as much as the visual effect.

**Stolen art is successful art.** Not a lesson I'd recommend optimizing for, but still.

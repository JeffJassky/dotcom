# **Museum of Natural History**Interactive tour app using 400 Bluetooth Beacons

### 2016

A prototype mobile app was developed for the Museum of Natural History in New York City. The app, A location-based tour through the history of the museum itself, would automatically present visitors with relevant multimedia as they walk by each exhibit. Visitors' locations were triangulated using signal strength values from over 400 Bluetooth beacons spread around the 4 floors of the museum.

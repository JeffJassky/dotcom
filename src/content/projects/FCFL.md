# **Building a Community That Outlived Its Founders**

### Fat Cat Fab Lab (2014–Present)

I helped build a makerspace in Manhattan's West Village - from a cramped office with a laser cutter to a thriving community with $10,000/month in revenue. The best part? It's still running today, and the people who operate it probably don't even know who we are. That's exactly how it should be.

## Finding the Right Room

When I moved from Florida to NYC in 2014, I'd just come off building Tampa Hackerspace - bootstrapping and kickstarting a maker community from nothing. I needed to find my people again.

I visited every makerspace I could find. Hack Manhattan near Union Square. NYC Resistor in Brooklyn. TechShop downtown. Alpha One Labs in my neighborhood. They were fine. Good equipment, capable people.

Then I found a small group gathering every Tuesday in the West Village. A cramped office with a laser cutter, some soldering irons, and a DIY 3D printer. The resources were limited compared to other spaces.

But the people were different.

An engineer and jazz musician who lived inside a church. An installation artist who lived on an electric sailboat. People who weren't just technically sharp, but genuinely joyful to be around. I clicked with them immediately.

I started showing up every week.

## The People

The community that formed around Fat Cat Fab Lab was remarkable. Just scratching the surface:

**Peter Hartmann** - The jazz musician/engineer living in a church. Incredibly sharp, technically brilliant, and instrumental in everything we built. His personality made the space feel alive.

**Zach Friedman** - Now known as Voidstar Labs on YouTube. He was accelerated through our space, building the foundation for what became a significant following.

**Hackett** - Part of the legendary Madagascar Institute in New York, and one of the team leads on the TV show _Junkyard Wars_. He had a gift for getting attention and holding it - which is why he was great on camera. Successful at Burning Man events, and brought that same creative energy to our space.

**David Choi** - An electrical and radio genius. He once built coils wrapped around the walls of his apartment for wireless power transmission. You could walk into a room, hold up an LED light bulb, and it would light up from the ambient electromagnetic field. Just casually breaking physics in his living room.

**The FreeWrite founder** - The creator of the digital offline typewriter, working on his invention alongside everyone else.

And that's just a few names. Hundreds of people passed through - artists, engineers, teachers, students, founders - each leaving fragments of themselves in the space.

## The Uncertainty

For the first two years, we had no idea if we'd survive.

The leadership situation was strange. We barely knew who owned the building. We only interfaced with them through an intermediary who was never even in the country. All of us were putting in work daily to build something, with this ambient anxiety that the rug could be pulled out from under us at any moment by factors we weren't even aware of.

There was confusion. There was tension. But we kept showing up because we loved being there.

Winters were the best. We'd gather in that small office, nerd out on projects, and watch the snow fall in Greenwich Village outside the window. It was cramped and under-resourced, but cozy. A truly magical place, and a magical time that I think of incredibly fondly.

## The Scramble

Every summer, membership would dip. Everyone's outside enjoying themselves - nobody's thinking about laser cutters.

We'd scramble to make rent through other channels:

- **Office rentals** - Renting desks and small rooms to startup founders who wanted a more permanent setup
- **Marketing pushes** - Email campaigns, social media, connecting with school programs
- **Partnerships** - Building relationships with organizations that could send students our way

It was a team effort every time. We never had a single pivotal moment where everything clicked. Each year just got a little easier. We found our rhythm. Our reputation spread. Word of mouth started doing the work for us.

## The Bigger Space

Next door was a larger room - a former gym. We had access to it, but it was unusable. Over about six months, we cleared it out and built it up. New floors. New lights. Some walls. Turning an empty gym into a functional workshop.

As the space grew, so did the equipment. Real 3D printers. Table saws. Drill press. CNC router. Vinyl plotter. Vacuum former. Ceramics kiln. Photography equipment. Industrial sewing machines. Electronic diagnostic tools.

With more equipment came more classes:

- AI and machine learning workshops
- Photography fundamentals
- JavaScript robotics
- Holiday markets for crafters and vendors
- Presentations from makers visiting New York

The variety of what we could teach expanded, and so did the people we could reach.

## People Who Built Things

The space became a launchpad:

An art teacher at a fashion school learned leatherworking and started her own line of beautiful handbags.

A member named Woody built his fabrication skills and launched his own business.

Zach Friedman developed the projects and skills that became Voidstar Labs.

Countless others took classes, joined the community, learned to use tools they'd never touched before, and carried that capability into the rest of their lives.

---

## The Systems That Lasted

We built a membership program inspired by gyms - $110/month for 24/7 access with a personal keycard. We formalized the teaching program. We created processes for onboarding new members, maintaining equipment, and handling the inevitable broken band saw blades, clogged 3D printer nozzles, and laser lenses ruined when something caught fire.

Revenue grew from $0 to over $10,000/month. About 80 paying members, plus hundreds attending free events each month.

But the real achievement wasn't the revenue. It was building systems that could be passed down.

## The Legacy

Fat Cat Fab Lab is still running today. Still thriving. Still serving the community.

And not a single founding member is involved anymore.

The people who operate it now probably don't even know who we are. I love that. That's exactly how it should be.

A makerspace is a living organism. Energy comes in, energy goes out. There are always remnants left over from everyone who passes through - extra parts and materials, fragments of memories, tools that get used for years after the person who brought them has moved on.

I know there are things I left there that are probably still being used today. Scraps of my presence, mixed with scraps from hundreds of others, forming the substrate that new makers build on.

We didn't just build a space. We built a community. We built systems that worked well enough to outlive us. That's the whole point.

## Where It Came From

I've been taking things apart since I was a kid. Breaking stuff, putting it back together, fascinated by all the little mechanisms - how something works internally, how it holds itself together, how force transmits from one part to another.

When I got older, my dad got me a hobby-grade RC car - an Associated RC10-T. I took to it obsessively and raced for years. The combination of mechanical systems, competition, and community planted something that never went away.

Makerspaces are that same feeling, scaled up. Rooms full of people who want to understand how things work and build new things from that understanding. Helping create space for others to do this is one of my most meaningful accomplishments.

# **Building Tampa's Maker Movement**

### Tampa Hackerspace (2011–2014)

Before Tampa had a hackerspace, we had coffee shops and library meeting rooms. The **Tampa Bay Microcontrollers and Robotics** meetup was where the region's makers, tinkerers, and engineers gathered to talk shop—but talking was all we could do. You can't fire up a soldering iron at Starbucks.

I was part of that floating community, showing up to meetings with circuit diagrams and code, frustrated that we could never actually *build* anything together. We needed a home.

## The Museum Experiment

In 2011, the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) reached out to our community. They were building something called **The Idea Zone**—a maker space inside the museum—and wanted input from actual makers.

I came on as a volunteer and informal consultant. I helped set up their 3D printers, tested equipment, fixed things when they broke, taught classes, and mentored a FIRST Robotics team of high schoolers. It was exciting to finally have access to real tools.

But as The Idea Zone took shape, something became clear: this was going to be a kids' playground for tech. And that made sense for a museum—laser-cut keychains and 3D-printed toys are perfect for school field trips. But we needed *real* equipment. A machine shop. A wood shop. Welding. Plasma cutting. Things you can't put next to a gift shop.

We needed our own space.

## The Kickstarter

In early 2013, a core group of us—myself, Ryan Holmes, Bill Shaw, Jon Adair, and others—decided to make it happen. We'd lease a space, buy equipment, and build Tampa's first real hackerspace.

To raise the capital, we turned to Kickstarter. I led the campaign strategy and wrote and directed the video pitch. We reached out to Mayor Bob Buckhorn's office to explain what we were building, and they gave us an endorsement:

> "Tampa Hackerspace is a place where the best and brightest want to be." — Mayor Bob Buckhorn, Tampa, FL

The campaign launched with a $10,000 goal. We promised to use every dollar for tools: a laser cutter, a delta 3D printer, soldering stations, bench power supplies, and eventually a CNC mill.

**We raised $16,185 from 157 backers**—over 160% of our goal.

## The Garcia y Vega Building

In August 2013, we moved into a 1,600 square foot space in a historic cigar factory at 3104 North Armenia Avenue. The building had the perfect industrial grit—high ceilings, exposed brick, and the lingering atmosphere of 19th-century manufacturing.

CoWork Tampa occupied the floors above us, creating a vertical slice of Tampa's tech scene: software and business upstairs, hardware and fabrication downstairs.

We immediately started booking classes and holding weekly Open Make Nights. The Tampa Bay Microcontrollers group finally had a permanent home. Within months, we had 25 paying members, and our Open Make Nights regularly drew 20-40 people.

## The Equipment

The Kickstarter funds went exactly where we promised. We acquired:

- A Full Spectrum 40-watt laser cutter
- A DeltaMaker 3D printer (plus our existing Solidoodle 2)
- Professional soldering stations and bench power supplies
- The beginnings of a proper electronics lab

## Building Brobot

Tampa Hackerspace became my workshop for **Brobot**, the robotic drummer I was developing at the time. I'd started early prototypes at The Idea Zone, but the hackerspace gave me the space and community to take it further. Having 24/7 access to a laser cutter and a room full of people who understood stepper motors and MIDI protocols made all the difference.

## The Legacy

The space eventually outgrew the cigar factory. By 2016, membership had grown into the hundreds, and they relocated to a 12,000 square foot industrial facility on Nassau Street. Members went on to win NASA's Cube Quest Challenge and build satellites for deep space missions.

But that's the thing about building community infrastructure—it outlives your direct involvement. The hackerspace I helped found is still running today, still teaching classes, still hosting Open Make Nights, still giving Tampa's makers a place to build together.

## Art lover + tech nerd

I'm a creative technologist working across code, hardware, photography, film, robotics, and whatever else a project needs. I like building things where the hard part isn't just making it work, but making it feel right.

I work best with founders, studios, and small teams who are building something new - especially when the idea doesn't fit neatly into one discipline.
